2. Click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner
3. This creates your own copy of the project
4. Open your terminal/command prompt
5. Type this command (replace `YOUR-USERNAME` with your GitHub username):
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Walleto/Code/walleto.git

   cd walleto
   ```
